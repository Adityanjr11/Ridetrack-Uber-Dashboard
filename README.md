# Ridetrack-Uber-Dashboard
Uber Analytics Dashboard: A data-driven platform tracking Total Revenue &amp; Fleet KPIs. Visualizes "Hot Locations" for pickups/drops, most popular destinations, and average trip distances. Built to optimize ride-sharing efficiency through geospatial heatmaps and real-time operational metrics like revenue per vehicle and demand density.

📊 Operational KPIs & Data MetricsThis dashboard focuses on high-impact performance indicators (KPIs) to optimize fleet management and revenue growth.💰 Financial PerformanceTotal Revenue: Gross earnings aggregated across all vehicle classes and timeframes.Average Revenue per Trip: Calculated to identify the profitability of different service tiers (UberX vs. Black).Surge Impact: A breakdown of how much total revenue was generated specifically during surge pricing windows.🚗 Fleet EfficiencyAverage Distance per Vehicle: A key metric for monitoring vehicle wear-and-tear and fuel/energy efficiency.Idle vs. Active Time: Tracks the percentage of time drivers spend waiting for a request versus completing a trip.Average Trip Duration: Measures the efficiency of route navigation and traffic impact.📍 Geospatial Demand (Hotspots)Hottest Pick-up Locations: Identifies high-density "Request Zones" where driver supply should be concentrated.Most Frequent Drop-off Points: Pinpoints popular end-destinations (airports, stadiums, business districts).Popular Route Corridors: Analysis of the most common A-to-B paths taken by riders to optimize future routing algorithms.🧮 How These Metrics Are CalculatedThe dashboard processes raw trip logs using the following logic:Average Distance: $$\text{Avg Distance} = \frac{\sum (\text{Trip Distance})}{\text{Total Count of Active Vehicles}}$$Revenue Density: Calculated by mapping total earnings against specific GPS coordinates to create a "Revenue Heatmap."
